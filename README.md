# Printing Code Projects

This is a repository containing my projects from Rune Madsen's [Printing Code](http://printingcode.runemadsen.com/) class.

## Running the projects

You need a web server to see the examples in your browser. Luckily, this repo has a script to do this. Run the following from inside the project folder.

```bash
bash server.sh
```

Now, go to [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) and navigate to any project folder.
